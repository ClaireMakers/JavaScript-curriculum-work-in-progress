Build the Gig basic back-end for the next module, that will return some gigs and that we will use in the React modules. This will be used as part of the useEffect and fetch bit of the curriculum 


- build up on Express skills too - creating a back-end for gig would be great for that, and maybe include some slightly more complex data manipulation, like for instance returning only one gig based on id. They would also need to write the tests for this too. 

- build up on fetch - maybe a challenge to let them create a post request? I could write a small server that takes post requests for that one. This could also be re-used in the React application context. We can also challenge them to handle errors well too. --> that's a maybe, since they do a bit of that in React modules and now the building a simple server section is beefier
